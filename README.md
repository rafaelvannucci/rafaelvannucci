### The Do’s and Don’ts of Scheduling Meetings

As I'm recovering from [Burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout), this guide will help myself to fastly recover and protect from other crisis, so thank you for following it: 🙇‍♂️
- Make sure you really need a meeting before scheduling it. Could this be resolved asynchronously by slack instead?
- Every meeting should have a purpose: You either need to make a decision or complete an action together.
- Do not schedule more time than you need. Most meetings are scheduled for a full hour, when they should be 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or 30 minutes—max.
- Start on time. Don’t wait for stragglers—it only encourages them.
- End on time. Saying, “I know we’ve all got a lot to do, so let’s try and keep this under 30 minutes,” will remind people that you want an efficient meeting just as much as they do.
- Only invite the people who absolutely need to be there.
- If you want people to read something ahead of time, sending it at least three hours ahead of time is good, and the day before is better.
- Book your meeting space ahead of time, or give yourself 10 minutes before the meeting to figure it out. Wandering the halls with everyone in tow is wasting everyone's time.
- Set an agenda, and share it at the beginning of the meeting to keep everyone on track.
- If the meeting is over an hour long, schedule time for breaks, and let attendees know about them ahead of time. Knowing they can check their email in 45 minutes will help keep them focused now.
